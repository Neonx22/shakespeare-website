    <h1>The Globe Theatre</h1>

    <p>
        The Globe Theatre was one of the most famous theatres in England and is
        closely associated with William Shakespeare. It was built in 1599 on
        the south bank of the River Thames in London by Shakespeare’s acting
        company, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men.
    </p>

    <p>
        The theatre was designed as a large circular structure and was open to
        the sky. Performances took place in daylight, as there was no electric
        lighting at that time. The stage projected into the audience, allowing
        actors and viewers to interact closely.
    </p>

    <p>
        People from all social classes attended plays at the Globe Theatre.
        Wealthy audience members sat in covered galleries, while poorer people,
        known as “groundlings,” stood in the open yard near the stage.
        This made theatre an important form of entertainment for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1613, during a performance of <i>Henry VIII</i>, a cannon fired as part
        of the show caused the theatre to catch fire. The Globe Theatre was
        completely destroyed but was rebuilt the following year in 1614.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, the theatre did not last long after its reconstruction.
        In 1644, it was demolished due to the Puritan government, which believed
        theatres encouraged immoral behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, a modern reconstruction known as Shakespeare’s Globe stands near
        the original site. It serves as a working theatre and educational centre,
        helping people understand Elizabethan theatre and Shakespeare’s lasting
        contribution to literature.
